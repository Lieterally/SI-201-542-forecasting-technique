# Jupyter Notebook for SI 201 542 (Forecasting Technique)

In the previous academic year, we used (Hanke, 2014) as the main reference
for this lecture.   

Now we shift to use more recent reference that uses Python as its main 
programming language and also explored some deep learning architecture. 

The following jupyter notebook files and all the data set 
in this repo is completely based on (Peixeiro, 2022). 
The notebooks of this book 
can be found in [Peixeiro's GitHub](https://github.com/marcopeix/TimeSeriesForecastingInPython)
